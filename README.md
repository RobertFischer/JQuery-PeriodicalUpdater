A port of Prototype's `Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater` function to jQuery.

Basically, this function polls some remote service at fairly regular internvals,
and (optionally) processes the result via a callback.  The period of calls will
decay as long as the same response keeps coming back from the server (either in
the form of repeated data or in the form of a 304 Not Modified status), which
reduces the load on the server naturally.   The first Ajax call happens as a page
'onReady' handler (ie: the `jQuery(function)` call), so it is safe to put the PeriodicalUpdater call
anywhere onhttps://github.com/Polzme/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater/blob/master/README.md the page.

Usage

    $.PeriodicalUpdater('/path/to/service', {
        method: 'get',          // method; get or post
        data: '',               // array of values to be passed to the page - e.g. {name: "John", greeting: "hello"}
        minTimeout: 1000,       // starting value for the timeout in milliseconds
        maxTimeout: 8000,       // maximum length of time between requests
        multiplier: 2,          // the amount to expand the timeout by if the response hasn't changed (up to maxTimeout)
        type: 'text',           // response type - text, xml, json, etc.  See $.ajax config options
        maxCalls: 0,            // maximum number of calls. 0 = no limit.
        autoStop: 0             // automatically stop requests after this many returns of the same data. 0 = disabled.
    }, function(remoteData, success, xhr, handle) {
        // Process the new data (only called when there was a change)
    });

The "data" value can be one of three things:

* A scalar, in which case it will be used constantly.
* A JSON map/object, in which case it will be turned into key/value pairs by jQuery
* An anonymous function, in which case it will be executed before each AJAX call.  See 
[jQuery.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) for more information.

You can also change the period between each AJAX call by overriding the boosPeriod function.

Usage:

    $.PeriodicalUpdater('/path/to/service', {
        method: 'get',          // method; get or post
        data: '',               // array of values to be passed to the page - e.g. {name: "John", greeting: "hello"}
        minTimeout: 1000,       // starting value for the timeout in milliseconds
        maxTimeout: 8000,       // maximum length of time between requests
        multiplier: 2,          // the amount to expand the timeout by if the response hasn't changed (up to maxTimeout)
        type: 'text',           // response type - text, xml, json, etc.  See $.ajax config options
        maxCalls: 0,            // maximum number of calls. 0 = no limit.
        autoStop: 0,             // automatically stop requests after this many returns of the same data. 0 = disabled.
        boostPeriod: function(minTimeout, maxTimeout, timer, calls) {
          return timer*2;       // This will request after 1sec, 2sec, 4sec, 8sec... etc etc etc...
        },
        boostWhenNotModified: true      // this will update the interval through boostPeriod function even if the AJAX result is not modified. (default to false)
    }, function(remoteData, success, xhr, handle) {
        // Process the new data (only called when there was a change)
    });

Any of the other standard $.ajax configuration options can be passed to the setting map.  
The only exception is the flag that treats modifications as errors. Thatâ€™s always
going to be 'true'.

The function call returns a handle.  You can call `.stop()` on this handle in order to stop
the updating and ignore any subsequent responses.  If the maximum number of calls, `.stop()`, or 
the autoStop has been triggered, you can restart the updater using `.restart()` on the handle.
This handle is also passed into the callback function as the fourth argument.
