A port of Prototype's Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater function to jQuery.

Basically, this function polls some remote service at fairly regular internvals, 
and (optionally) processes the result via a callback.  The period of calls will
decay as long as the same response keeps coming back from the server (either in
the form of repeated data or in the form of a 304 Not Modified status), which 
reduces the load on the server naturally.   The first Ajax call happens as a page 
'onReady' handler $(function), so it is safe to put the PeriodicalUpdater call 
anywhere on the page.

Usage:
$.PeriodicalUpdater('/path/to/service', {
	method: 'get',          // method; get or post
	sendData: '',           // array of values to be passed to the page - e.g. {name: "John", greeting: "hello"}
	minTimeout: 1000,       // starting value for the timeout in milliseconds
	maxTimeout: 8000,       // maximum length of time between requests
	multiplier: 2,          // if set to 2, timerInterval will double each time the response hasn't changed (up to maxTimeout)
	type: 'text'            // response type - text, xml, json, etc.  See $.ajax config options
}, function(data) {
	// Handle the new data (only called when there was a change)
});

Any other $.ajax configuration option can be passed to the setting map.  The 
only exception is the flag that treats modifications as errors. That’s always 
going to be 'true'.
